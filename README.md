# CelesteTAS-EverestInterop - Everest interop for DevilSquirrel's CelesteTAS

### License: MIT

----

### WIP.

This mod loads [DevilSquirrel's CelesteTAS](https://github.com/ShootMe/CelesteTAS) `Celeste-Addons.dll` and makes it work with [Everest](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Everest).

Note that this mod is useless on its own - you need to place the [mod .zip](/releases) into the `Mods` directory and the `Celeste-Addons.dll` into the Celeste installation directory, next to `Celeste.exe`.

Check the README of [DevilSquirrel's CelesteTAS](https://github.com/ShootMe/CelesteTAS) for how to set up CelesteTAS.

**Note that this isn't officially supported and compatibility with "Celeste Studio" can break any time in the future.**
